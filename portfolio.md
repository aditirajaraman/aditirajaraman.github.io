> Strokes are one of the most prevalent medical issues without a cure, killing approximately 137,000 people each year. The only way to prevent a stroke from happening is by knowing if a patient is going to have one beforehand. However, the only way to do this, as of now, is in a medical setting under heavy, medical equipment. Many heart patients may not have the funds, nor the ability to live freely under these circumstances. So, I performed research on strokes, and realized that many of the symptoms of a stroke is easily accesible, portable, and affordable. I used IoMT Biosensors available in the market to record paramenters such as Heart Rate or SPO~2~. I also used passive input data, data which is collected from a patient's doctor's office. These sets of input data were fed into a Machine Learning Model I built using the programming language, Python.

With the integration of software and hardware, I was able to create an affordable, portable wearable which will detect a stroke before it happens. This solution was targeted for those living in poverty, and living in rural, underfunded areas or cities where healthcare is undeveloped.
