# Researcher, Writer & Robotics
> - During the summer after seventh grade, I made my first hardware project using a Raspberry Pi kit, coding commands for them using the programming language, Python. I used female and male wires, plugging them into the holes of a white board connected to the raspberry pi, aligning them with resisters, and a single LED. After running the code I had written after, the led would turn on, flashing whenever the code instructed it to. From there, I completed more projects with varying complexity. At the end of summer, I built an attendence tracker using a motion sensor for places with a limit.

> - I started Creative Writing when I was in fifth grade, and wrote my first poem in sixth grade. I submitted this poem to the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards where I recieved the highesst award offered at the regional level. This region included the following states: Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachussets, Conneticut, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. I was the youngest among my competition, ranging from 8th to 12th grade.
